# Privacy Policy for Zhihu-md

**Last Updated: January 1, 2025**

Zhihu-md ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension (the "Extension") handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection

We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any meaningful personal data.

- **No Remote Transmission**: The Extension operates entirely on your local device. It acts as a bridge between the Zhihu page you are viewing and the Markdown file you generate. No data is sent to our servers or any third-party servers.
- **No Analytics**: We do not use Google Analytics or any other tracking software to monitor your usage of the Extension.
- **Permissions**: The Extension requests permissions (`activeTab`, `downloads`, `scripting`, `webNavigation`, `storage`) strictly to perform its core function: converting the content of the current Zhihu page into a Markdown file and saving it to your computer.

## 2. Data Usage

Any data processed by the Extension (specifically, the text and images from the Zhihu pages you interact with) is used solely for the purpose of generating the Markdown file. This process happens locally in your browser.

## 3. Data Storage

The Extension may use your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage`) to save your preferences (e.g., settings for the floating ball or template choices). This data remains on your local device and is not synchronized with any remote server unless you enable Chrome's built-in sync feature, in which case it is handled according to Google's Privacy Policy.

## 4. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by opening an issue on our GitHub repository.
